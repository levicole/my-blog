Hey Guys.  Right now I am in the process of moving my Habari blog over to Marley, which uses git instead of a database.  Stay tuned!  I am going to try to gather all my posts from my typo blog, my posts from the Habari blog so that I have everything in one place.  I am also going to get a nice little layout in the upcoming weeks as well.
